[Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) is an open-source AI orchestration framework built by [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai/) that empowers Python developers to build **real-world, compound, agentic LLM applications**.

Whether you‚Äôre building **autonomous agents**, **multi-modal apps**, or **scalable RAG systems**, Haystack gives you the tools to go from idea to production with ease. Its powerful, modular architecture helps you try out state-of-the-art methods, customize deeply when needed, and stay in control of your stack.

Backed by an inspiring [community](https://haystack.deepset.ai/community) of developers, Haystack has evolved into a **complete and intuitive framework** for LLM-based development.

```bash
pip install -U haystack-ai
```

## Who is Haystack For?

Haystack is for builders of all kinds‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre prototyping your first Gen AI app or deploying sophisticated systems at scale. If you know a bit of Python, you‚Äôre ready to start.

You can build directly in Python, visually with [deepset Studio](https://www.deepset.ai/deepset-studio), or scale up with enterprise-grade infrastructure on the [deepset AI Platform](https://www.deepset.ai/products-and-services/deepset-ai-platform). Whatever your level or need, Haystack gives you the power to build, experiment, and launch faster.

## Why Developers Love Haystack

Built for production from day one, Haystack is the leading open-source framework for building reliable, flexible, and composable LLM applications from first prototype to full-scale deployment. 

Here‚Äôs why developers choose Haystack:

- **Build flexible pipelines** using Haystack‚Äôs built-in components like retrievers, generators, rankers, agent, or [create your own](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/custom-components).
- **Customize with full control** by [adding loops and branches to your pipeline](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/pipelines), and tailor data flow to fit your use case.
- **Integrate smoothly** with [model providers, vector databases, and AI tools](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations) in a modular, swappable architecture
- **Deploy effortlessly** and serve your pipelines as REST APIs or as an MCP Server using with [Hayhooks](https://github.com/deepset-ai/hayhooks).
- **Monitor and optimize** using built-in [tracing](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/tracing), [logging](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/logging), and [evaluation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/evaluation) tools for full observability.
- **Rely on robust engineering** with clean architecture, careful dependency management, and a [breaking change policy](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/breaking-change-policy) that ensures no bad surprises.

Whether it‚Äôs **agent workflows, retrieval over millions of docs, text-to-SQL or** **PDF parsing,** Haystack scales with your idea without scaling your complexity.

## The deepset Ecosystem

At deepset, we‚Äôre building the tools to make LLMs truly usable in production‚Äîopen source and beyond.

- [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) ‚Üí Our core framework for LLM orchestration, launched in 2020 and now at v2.
- [deepset Studio](https://www.deepset.ai/deepset-studio) ‚Üí A free visual interface for building pipelines, experimenting with data, and deploying apps faster.
- [deepset AI Platform](https://www.deepset.ai/products-and-services/deepset-ai-platform) ‚Üí An enterprise-ready platform for teams running Gen AI apps in production, with security, governance, and scalability built in.
