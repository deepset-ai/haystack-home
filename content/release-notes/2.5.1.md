### ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancement Notes

- Add `default_headers` init argument to `AzureOpenAIGenerator` and `AzureOpenAIChatGenerator`

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix the Pipeline visualization issue due to changes in the new release of Mermaid
- Fix `Pipeline` not running Components with Variadic input even if it received inputs only from a subset of its senders
- The `from_dict` method of `ConditionalRouter` now correctly handles the case where the `dict` passed to it contains the key `custom_filters` explicitly set to `None`. Previously this was causing an `AttributeError`
