We’re making some naming and visual updates at deepset to better reflect the role Haystack already plays as a framework, a community, and the foundation of our enterprise platform.

If you’re already building with Haystack, nothing is changing in how you build or run applications. This update is about clarity—making the Haystack ecosystem easier to understand, easier to navigate, and centered around a single open foundation.

## The Open Source to Enterprise Story of Haystack

**Haystack** began as an open-source framework for building NLP pipelines, created to give developers precise control over how AI systems are composed, debugged, and run in production. From the start, it was designed for real-world use, not just experimentation.

Over time, the framework expanded and so did the community. Teams began using Haystack to power increasingly sophisticated systems in production: **advanced RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, and multi-step, multimodal applications operating over complex enterprise data**. As adoption and contribution grew, Haystack evolved from a framework into a broader ecosystem, shaped by its community and proven in demanding production environments.

As enterprises scaled their use of Haystack, the need for additional operational capabilities emerged. The deepset AI Platform evolved alongside the framework, built on the same architecture, abstractions, and mental model to support governance, deployment, and collaboration at scale. Renaming it to **Haystack Enterprise Platform** reflects how the open-source framework and enterprise operational tooling are already used together in practice.

If you know Haystack, you already understand the foundation of the enterprise platform. The new name reflects how teams use Haystack across development, production, and enterprise-scale environments without changing tools, rewriting systems, or navigating brand confusion when choosing the right Haystack offering.

## The Haystack Logo: What Changed and Why

Alongside the naming change, we’re updating the **Haystack logo** and **overall look**.

This isn’t just a change in appearance. It reflects how Haystack is used today and how the ecosystem has evolved.

Haystack is no longer only a framework, it’s the foundation across everything we ship. Haystack Open Source, Haystack Enterprise Starter, and Haystack Enterprise Platform now share a consistent look, reflecting their place within a single Haystack family.

The updated logo reflects Haystack’s role in building complete AI systems. It aligns with how Haystack is used today—bringing agents, retrieval, pipelines, and operational concerns together while staying true to its core values of openness, clarity and structure.

## The Haystack Product Family

The Haystack product family supports teams across the full lifecycle of enterprise AI adoption—from development to production and organization-wide scale. It includes the **Haystack Framework**, **Haystack Enterprise Starter**, and **Haystack Enterprise Platform**. 
These are layers teams can grow into as their use of Haystack matures.

### What Is Haystack?

If you’re new to **Haystack**, it’s an open-source AI orchestration framework developed by deepset that enables Python developers to build sophisticated, agentic AI applications.

It provides a modular pipeline architecture with a rich ecosystem of integrations, while preserving full flexibility to add custom components and external tools, including those from MCP servers. With robust documentation and production-ready capabilities such as serialization, logging, and well-defined APIs, Haystack supports reliable deployment across both cloud and on-premise environments.

Haystack is designed to help teams move from experimentation to production without sacrificing control or architectural clarity—and is already used in production by many teams today.

### What Is Haystack Enterprise Starter?

**Haystack Enterprise Starter** combines the **Haystack open-source framework** with **enterprise-grade support** to help teams move more quickly and confidently toward production.

It’s designed for teams already building with the Haystack framework who want additional guidance and reduced implementation risk, including:

- Private and dedicated consulting and support
- Secure pipeline and deployment design guidance
- Proven deployment blueprints and production pipeline templates
- A clear path to expand as requirements evolve

Enterprise Starter serves as a practical stepping stone for teams preparing for broader adoption and more complex production use cases.

_Haystack Enterprise Starter was previously known as Haystack Enterprise._

### What Is Haystack Enterprise Platform?

**Haystack Enterprise Platform** extends Haystack with the tooling needed to run AI systems reliably in production at enterprise scale.

It builds on the same architecture, abstractions, and mental model the developer community already uses in Haystack, adding operational capabilities for deploying, testing, and governing AI applications across complex data, multiple use cases, and different environments.

Key capabilities include:
- **Composable, repeatable pipeline orchestration** with visual views aligned with code
- **Production-ready indexing and retrieval** for large, complex enterprise data
- **Integrated testing and evaluation** to validate changes and improve system behavior over time
- **Access control and auditability** for shared, multi-team environments
- **Scalable deployment** across cloud and on-premise setups

Built on Haystack’s open-source foundation and shaped by real-world production use, Haystack Enterprise Platform helps teams elevate Haystack pipelines into enterprise systems they can operate, share, and scale across the organization.

## Looking Ahead

With these changes, Haystack is easier to understand, easier to navigate, and easier to adopt across the product family.

This evolution reflects how Haystack is used in practice today—as an open, modular foundation for development and the core of a platform supporting production AI systems ranging from retrieval-based pipelines to agent-based workflows.

We’ll keep building Haystack together with the community, customers, and partners—focused on transparent, debuggable, production-grade AI systems teams can trust and evolve over time.
