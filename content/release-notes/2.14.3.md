## üêõ Bug Fixes

-   In ConditionalRouter fixed the `to_dict` and `from_dict` methods to properly handle the case when `output_type` is a List of types or a List of strings. This occurs when a user specifies a route in ConditionalRouter to have multiple outputs.
-   Fix the serialization of ComponentTool and Tool when specifying `outputs_to_string`. Previously an error occurred on deserialization right after serializing if `outputs_to_string` is not None.
