We believe open-source is more than open-source code. It's about the collaboration, transparency, and trust.
Therefore, we decided to be as open as possible with our roadmap.
In fact, you can see all of our quarterly roadmap items on GitHub.
We hope this helps to clarify the direction of the open-source project and inspires discussions in the community.

[Our most recent roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/deepset-ai/projects/3/views/1) is hosted on Github.
Here you will find the **high-level projects** that we have planned for the upcoming quarters.
We update it regularly and refine the projects as their start date approaches.
