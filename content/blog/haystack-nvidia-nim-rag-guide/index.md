Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine generative AI with information retrieval for contextualized answer generation. Building reliable and performant RAG applications at scale is challenging. In this blog, we show how to use Haystack and NVIDIA NIM to create a RAG solution which is easy to deploy/maintain, standardized and enterprise-ready, that can run on-prem as well as on cloud native environments. This recipe is applicable in the cloud, on-premise or even in air-gapped environments.

## About Haystack

[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/), by [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai/), is an open source framework for building production-ready LLM applications, RAG pipelines and state-of-the-art search systems that work intelligently over large document collections. Haystackâ€™s [growing ecosystem of community integrations](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations) provide tooling for evaluation, monitoring, transcription, data ingestion and more. The [NVIDIA Haystack integration](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations/nvidia) allows using NVIDIA models and NIM microservices in Haystack pipelines, [giving the flexibility to pivot from prototyping in the cloud to deploying on-prem](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/haystack-nvidia-integration).

## About NVIDIA NIM

NVIDIA NIM is a collection of containerized microservices designed for optimized inference of state-of-the-art  AI models.  The container uses a variety of components to serve AI models and exposes them via standard API. Models are optimized using [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) or TensorRT-LLM (depending on the type of the model), applying procedures such as quantization, model distribution, optimized kernel/runtimes and inflight- or continuous batching among others allowing even further optimization if needed. Learn more about NIM here.

## Build a Haystack RAG pipeline with NVIDIA NIM

For RAG pipelines, Haystack provides 3 components that can be connected with NVIDIA NIM: 
- [NvidiaGenerator](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/nvidiagenerator): Text generation with self-deployed LLM NIM.
- [NvidiaDocumentEmbedder](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/nvidiadocumentembedder): Document embedding with self-deployed NVIDIA NeMo
- [Embedding NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/embed-qa-4) to be stored in vector stores.
- [NvidiaTextEmbedder](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/nvidiatextembedder): Query embedding with self-deployed NeMo Retriever embedding NIM.

For this section, we have provided scripts and instructions for building a RAG pipeline with models hosted by NVIDIA (so you can start even if you do not have access to the `rag-with-nvidia-nims` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deepset-ai/nvidia-haystack). A [self-hosted notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepset-ai/haystack-cookbook/blob/main/notebooks/rag-with-nims.ipynb) is provided for the same pipeline using self-hosted NIMs. 

## Vectorize Documents with Haystack Indexing Pipelines

Our indexing pipeline implementation is available in the [indexing tutorial](https://github.com/deepset-ai/nvidia-haystack/blob/main/indexing.py). Haystack provides several [preprocessing](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/preprocessors) components for document cleaning, splitting, [embedders](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/converters), as well as [converters](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/converters) extracting data from files in different formats. In this tutorial, we will store PDF files in a `QdrantDocumentStore`. `NvidiaDocumentEmbedder` is used to connect with models hosted by NVIDIA accessible [here](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/retrieval). Below is an example of how to initialize the embedder component with the NVIDIA-hosted [`snowflake/arctic-embed-l`](https://build.nvidia.com/snowflake/arctic-embed-l) model.

```python
from haystack.utils.auth import Secret
from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.nvidia import NvidiaDocumentEmbedder


embedder = NvidiaDocumentEmbedder(model="snowflake/arctic-embed-l",
                                  api_url="https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/retrieval/snowflake/arctic-embed-l",
                                  batch_size=1)
```

## Creating the Haystack RAG Pipeline

In our example, we will create a simple question/answering RAG pipeline using both Embedding Retrieval and LLM NIMs. For this pipeline, we use the NvidiaTextEmbedder to embed the query for retrieval, and the NvidiaGenerator to generate a response. An example is shown below for how to instantiate the generator using [`meta/llama3-70b-instruct` as an NVIDIA hosted LLM NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama3-70b).

```python
generator = NvidiaGenerator(
    model="meta/llama3-70b-instruct",
    api_url="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
    model_arguments={
        "max_tokens": 1024
    }
)
```


We use Haystack pipelines to connect various components of this RAG pipeline including query embedders and LLM generators. Below is an example of a RAG pipeline:

```python
from haystack import Pipeline
from haystack.utils.auth import Secret
from haystack.components.builders import PromptBuilder
from haystack_integrations.components.embedders.nvidia import NvidiaTextEmbedder
from haystack_integrations.components.generators.nvidia import NvidiaGenerator
from haystack_integrations.components.retrievers.qdrant import QdrantEmbeddingRetriever
from haystack_integrations.document_stores.qdrant import QdrantDocumentStore

document_store = QdrantDocumentStore(embedding_dim=1024, host="qdrant")

embedder = NvidiaTextEmbedder(model="snowflake/arctic-embed-l", 
                                  api_key=Secret.from_env_var("NVIDIA_EMBEDDINGS_KEY"), 
                                  api_url="https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/retrieval/snowflake/arctic-embed-l")

retriever = QdrantEmbeddingRetriever(document_store=document_store)

prompt = """Answer the question given the context.
Question: {{ query }}
Context:
{% for document in documents %}
    {{ document.content }}
{% endfor %}
Answer:"""
prompt_builder = PromptBuilder(template=prompt)

generator = NvidiaGenerator(
    model="meta/llama3-70b-instruct",
    api_url="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
    model_arguments={
        "max_tokens": 1024
    }
)

rag = Pipeline()
rag.add_component("embedder", embedder)
rag.add_component("retriever", retriever)
rag.add_component("prompt", prompt_builder)
rag.add_component("generator", generator)

rag.connect("embedder.embedding", "retriever.query_embedding")
rag.connect("retriever.documents", "prompt.documents")
rag.connect("prompt", "generator")
```

## Indexing Files and Deploying the Haystack RAG Pipeline

[Hayhooks](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/hayhooks) allows the deployment of RAG pipelines in a containerized environment. In our example, we have provided [a docker-compose file](https://github.com/deepset-ai/nvidia-haystack/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) to set up both the Qdrant database, and the RAG pipeline. As we are using NVIDIA-hosted models, we need to set the API keys for the listed models on the .env file. The instructions below expect an `NVIDIA_API_KEY` (for `NvidiaGenerator`) and `NVIDIA_EMBEDDINGS_KEY` (for `NvidiaDocumentEmbedder` and `NvidiaTextEmbedder`). 

Executing `docker-compose up` will launch 3 containers: **qdrant**, **hayhooks** and **qdrant-setup** (which will run our indexing pipeline and stop). The Qdrant database will be deployed on the localhost and exposed at port 6333. The Qdrant dashboard allows users to inspect the vectorized documents at **localhost:6333/dashboard**.

### Serializing Pipelines

Haystack pipelines defined in Python can be serialized to YAML by calling **dump()** on the pipeline object, as shown in [our RAG pipeline tutorial](https://github.com/deepset-ai/nvidia-haystack/blob/77cc316193e718de51b8a56e756749604b8032e9/rag.py#L44C1-L45C16). The [YAML](https://github.com/deepset-ai/nvidia-haystack/blob/main/rag.yaml) definition is the following:

```yaml
components:
  embedder:
    ...
    type: haystack_integrations.components.embedders.nvidia.text_embedder.NvidiaTextEmbedder
  generator:
    init_parameters:
      api_key:
        ...
    type: haystack_integrations.components.generators.nvidia.generator.NvidiaGenerator
  prompt:
    init_parameters:
      template: "Answer the question given the context.\nQuestion: {{ query }}\nContext:\n\
        {% for document in documents %}\n    {{ document.content }}\n{% endfor %}\n\
        Answer:"
    type: haystack.components.builders.prompt_builder.PromptBuilder
  retriever:
    init_parameters:
      document_store:
        init_parameters:
          ...
        type: haystack_integrations.document_stores.qdrant.document_store.QdrantDocumentStore
      ...
    type: haystack_integrations.components.retrievers.qdrant.retriever.QdrantEmbeddingRetriever

connections:
- receiver: retriever.query_embedding
  sender: embedder.embedding
- receiver: prompt.documents
  sender: retriever.documents
- receiver: generator.prompt
  sender: prompt.prompt
max_loops_allowed: 100
metadata: {}
```

### Deploy the RAG Pipeline

To deploy the RAG pipeline, execute `hayhooks deploy rag.yaml` which will expose the pipeline on localhost:1416/rag by default. You can then visit http://localhost:1416/docs and try out your pipeline. 

For production, Haystack provides Helm charts and [instructions](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/kubernetes) to create services running Hayhooks with a container orchestrator like Kubernetes. 

In the next sections, we will show how to self deploy NVIDIA NIM on a Kubernetes cluster, monitor the application using the NIM microserviceâ€™s exposed metrics and autoscale the application according to predefined metrics. Finally, we will provide instructions on how to use the self-deployed NIM in the Haystack RAG pipeline. 

## Deployment of NVIDIA NIM on a Kubernetes Cluster

### Kubernetes Cluster Environment

In this tutorial, the setup environment consists of a DGX H100 with 8 H100 GPUs each having 80GB of memory as GPU host and with Ubuntu as the operating system. Docker is used as the container engine. Kubernetes is deployed on it using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/). To enable GPU utilization in Kubernetes, we install essential NVIDIA software components using the [GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html).

### NVIDIA NIM Deployment

As part of this setup, we deploy two NIMs into the Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts:
- The LLM NIM, which uses the model [`llama3-8b-instruct`](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama3-8b)
- The NeMo Retriever Embedding NIM, which uses the model [`NV-Embed-QA`](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/embed-qa-4)

The Helm chart for the LLM NIM is located in [GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nim-deploy) whereas the embedding NIM is located in the NGC private registry. For the embedding NIM, you would need EA access.  Figure 3 illustrates the deployment of NIM on a Kubernetes cluster running on a DGX H100. The GPU Operator components are deployed via its Helm chart and are part of the GPU Operator stack. Prometheus and Grafana are deployed via Helm charts for monitoring the Kubernetes cluster and the NIM.

The LLM NIM Helm chart contains the LLM NIM container, which runs within a pod and references the model on the host via [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PV) and [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) (PVC). The LLM NIM pods are autoscaled using the [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) (HPA) based on custom metrics and are exposed via Kubernetes [ClusterIP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-clusterip) service. To access the LLM NIM, we deploy an [ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) and expose it at the `/llm` endpoint.

Similarly, the NeMo Retriever Embedding microservice Helm chart includes the Retrieval Embedding NIM container, which runs within a pod and references the model on the host via Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim. The Retrieval Embedding NIM pods are also autoscaled via HPA and are exposed via Kubernetes ClusterIP service. To access the embedding NIM, we deploy an ingress and expose it at the `/embedding` endpoint.

Users and other applications can access the exposed NIMs via the ingress.
The vector database Qdrant is deployed using this [helm chart](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/installation/#kubernetes).

Now, let's take a closer look at the deployment process for each NIM:
