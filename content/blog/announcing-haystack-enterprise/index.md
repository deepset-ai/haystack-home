üíô Thanks to you and all of our amazing community members, the Haystack open source framework has grown into a thriving developer ecosystem, now used by thousands of organizations to power everything from simple Q&A bots to advanced enterprise agents. As more teams run Haystack in production, one thing has become increasingly clear: **building reliable AI systems is hard and scaling them securely is even harder**.

We‚Äôve had a front-row seat to these challenges. Across GitHub threads, meetups, community calls, and production deployments, developers have consistently asked for engineering support and hands-on guidance to **build for their use case**, **accelerate deployment**, **improve observability**, and **scale infrastructure with confidence**. These aren‚Äôt just feature requests; they reflect the real-world friction points of teams building AI products that actually ship.

We‚Äôve tackled many of these problems ourselves while building for customers on the [deepset AI Platform](https://www.deepset.ai/products-and-services/deepset-ai-platform). Now, we want to make that experience more accessible to the broader Haystack community.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre introducing **Haystack Enterprise** today. It adds secure support, best practices, and professional services availability for organizations scaling up their Haystack pipelines. ‚¨áÔ∏è

## What's Inside Haystack Enterprise
For developers building with Haystack, speed, reliability, and support are essential as projects move from prototype to production. Haystack Enterprise adds a new layer of readiness for exactly that:
* **Direct access to the Haystack team**    
    Get expert help with private email support and dedicated consultation hours.
* **Curated pipeline templates for faster developement**  
    Deploy out-of-the-box templates for advanced RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, and multimodal applications with built-in [Hayhooks](https://github.com/deepset-ai/hayhooks) and **Open WebUI** support, ready to go.
* **Helm charts and guides for secure, one-command deployments**   
    Run Haystack securely across Kubernetes clusters on AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-prem, backed by best setup, scaling, and upgrade practices.
* **Early access to enterprise-grade features**      
    Take advantage of capabilities like prompt injection countermeasures and other security-oriented features ahead of broader release.

Think of it as Haystack+, an offering designed to accelerate delivery and give teams the necessary production muscle.


## What About Open Source?
While Haystack Enterprise might be the right choice for some organizations, it may not be for others. Today‚Äôs news does not introduce any changes to the OSS community. Haystack started and will always remain as an open source framework. That isn‚Äôt changing.

We‚Äôre committed to keeping Haystack fully featured, well-documented, and free to use. You‚Äôll continue to get:
* [Open source codebase](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)
* Community-driven feature development and new [integrations](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations)
* [Tutorials](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials), [Cookbook](https://haystack.deepset.ai/cookbook), and other learning materials
* A welcoming, collaborative [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/Dr63fr9NDS) with support

**Haystack Enterprise is simply an opt-in layer for teams needing more support and guidance**. It‚Äôs designed for engineering teams running Haystack at scale who want faster deployment, higher reliability, and private channels to get expert help.

No license changes. No gated community features. Just more choices for teams building AI products.

## How Haystack Enterprise Fits into the Bigger Picture
We see Haystack Enterprise as part of a continuum that supports developers from the first prototype to full-scale production systems:
* [**Haystack**](https://haystack.deepset.ai/): Self-hosted and fully open source.
* [**Haystack Enterprise**](https://www.deepset.ai/products-and-services/haystack-enterprise): Production-grade support and best practices for teams who are scaling up. Includes secure deployment tooling, private engineering guidance, and early access to enterprise features.
* [**deepset AI Platform**](https://www.deepset.ai/products-and-services/deepset-ai-platform): A fully managed, end-to-end development and orchestration platform. Built for teams that want visual tooling, iterative testing, autoscaling, and centralized governance over resource and access management.

Now, you can start with Haystack, opt-in to Haystack Enterprise as you grow, and consider the Platform if you want to accelerate your development.
