## 🐛 Bug Fixes

-   Fixed a mypy issue in the OpenAIChatGenerator and its handling of stream responses. This issue only occurs with mypy \>=1.16.0.
-   Fix type comparison in schema validation by replacing `is not` with `!=` when checking the type `List[ChatMessage]`. This prevents false mismatches due to Python's `is` operator comparing object identity instead of equality.
