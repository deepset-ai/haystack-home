## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancement Notes

-  Refactored the processing of streaming chunks from OpenAI to simplify logic.
-  Added tests to ensure expected behavior when handling streaming chunks when using include_usage=True.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

-   Fixed issue with MistralChatGenerator not returning a <span class="title-ref">finish_reason</span> when using streaming. Fixed by adjusting how we look for the <span class="title-ref">finish_reason</span> when processing streaming chunks. Now, the last non-None <span class="title-ref">finish_reason</span> is used to handle differences between OpenAI and Mistral.
