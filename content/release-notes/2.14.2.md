## 🐛 Bug Fixes

-   Fixed a bug in `OpenAIDocumentEmbedder` and `AzureOpenAIDocumentEmbedder` where if an OpenAI API error occurred mid-batch then the following embeddings would be paired with the wrong documents.

## 🚀 New Features

-   Added a `raise_on_failure` boolean parameter to `OpenAIDocumentEmbedder` and `AzureOpenAIDocumentEmbedder`. If set to `True` then the component will raise an exception when there is an error with the API request. It is set to `False` by default so the previous behavior of logging an exception and continuing is still the default.
