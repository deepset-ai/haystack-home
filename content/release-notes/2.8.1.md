# Release Notes

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
-   Pin OpenAI client to \>=1.56.1 to avoid issues related to changes in the httpx library.
-   PyPDFToDocument now creates documents with id based on converted text and meta data. Before it didn't take the meta data into account.
-   Fixes issues with deserialization of components in multi-threaded environments.
