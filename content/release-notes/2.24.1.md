## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in flexible Pipeline connections that prevented automatic value conversion when the receiving component expects a Union type. For example, connecting a component returning `ChatMessage` to a receiver expecting `list[str] | list[ChatMessage]` should have worked but did not. The conversion strategy now correctly evaluates each branch of a Union receiver and picks the best match.
