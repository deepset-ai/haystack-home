#         Securing LLMs: How to detect prompt injections
#       description: > 
#         During this webinar, we will provide a detailed walkthrough on how we curated a dataset and trained a classifier that serves to detect prompt injections, using data augmentation techniques including translations and adversarial examples. Then, we will discuss how you can integrate this model into your AI system to improve its security.
