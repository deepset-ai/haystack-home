## ⚡️ Enhancement Notes

-   Updated pipeline execution logic to use a new utility method `_deepcopy_with_exceptions`, which attempts to deep copy an object and safely falls back to the original object if copying fails. Additionally `_deepcopy_with_exceptions` skips deep-copying of `Component`, `Tool`, and `Toolset` instances when used as runtime parameters. This prevents errors and unintended behavior caused by trying to deepcopy objects that contain non-copyable attributes (e.g. Jinja2 templates, clients). Previously, standard `deepcopy` was used on inputs and outputs which occasionally lead to errors since certain Python objects cannot be deepcopied.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

-   Make internal tool conversion in the HuggingFaceAPICompatibleChatGenerator compatible with huggingface_hub\>=0.31.0. In the huggingface_hub library, `arguments` attribute of `ChatCompletionInputFunctionDefinition` has been renamed to `parameters`. Our implementation is compatible with both the legacy version and the new one.
-   The `HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator` now checks the type of the `arguments` variable in the tool calls returned by the Hugging Face API. If `arguments` is a JSON string, it is parsed into a dictionary. Previously, the `arguments` type was not checked, which sometimes led to failures later in the tool workflow.
