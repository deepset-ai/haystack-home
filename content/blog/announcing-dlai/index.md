[DeepLearning.A](http://DeepLearning.AU)I and Andrew Ng hold a special place in many AI/ML engineers careers and development. For many engineers, they’ve played a pivotal role into breaking into AI, or extending their knowledge and capabilities by teaching about core concepts and technologies at the right time. So, we’re incredibly happy to announce that we’re launching our first short course with them - “Building AI Applications with Haystack”

[video with Andrey Ng]

## What you’ll learn

This course is designed with a bottom up approach, starting by teaching you about the building blocks of generative AI applications. Throughout the course, you’ll start to design and customize your own retrieval-augmented generative (RAG) pipelines, you’ll learn how to extend Haystack with custom capabilities for your own generative AI use case, you’ll even implement a simple self-reflecting agent and end the course by creating a full chat agent with function calling.

## Who is the course for?

If you’re new to AI, this course is a great way to start learning about the basics and how they come together to build some of the most useful GenAI use cases. It will also teach you the fundamentals of Haystack and how you can make use of our framework to build out your own applications. You certainly do not need to have a deep understanding or much prior knowledge, however, it will be useful for you to be familiar with Python. 

If you’re not new to AI, this course is a great way to get started with Haystack as a tool for you to make your GenAI use cases come to life. 

t's been an absolute pleasure for me to create this with the Haystack team and the [DeepLearning.AI](http://deeplearning.ai/) team. I. I’d love to hear what you think, and if you take the course and end up with questions, please join me for an [AMA session on September 10th](https://landing.deepset.ai/webinar-haystack-ama-session-deeplearning).
