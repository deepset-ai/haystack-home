## üêõ Bug Fixes

-   Fix `_convert_streaming_chunks_to_chat_message` which is used to convert Haystack `StreamingChunks` into a Haystack `ChatMessage`. This fixes the scenario where one StreamingChunk contains two `ToolCallDetlas` in StreamingChunk.tool_calls. With this fix this correctly saves both `ToolCallDeltas` whereas before they were overwriting each other. This only occurs with some LLM providers like Mistral (and not OpenAI) due to how the provider returns tool calls.
