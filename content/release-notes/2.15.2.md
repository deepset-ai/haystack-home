## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancement Notes

-   We‚Äôve relaxed the requirements for the `ToolCallDelta` dataclass (introduced in Haystack 2.15). Previously, creating a `ToolCallDelta` instance required either the parameters argument or the name to be set. This constraint has now been removed to align more closely with OpenAI's SDK behavior.
The change was necessary as the stricter requirement was causing errors in certain hosted versions of open-source models that adhere to the OpenAI SDK specification.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

-   Fixed a bug in the `print_streaming_chunk` utility function that prevented `ToolCall` name from being printed.
