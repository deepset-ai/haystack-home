## ⭐️ Highlights

### Enhancements for Complex Agentic Systems
We've improved agent workflows with better message handling and streaming support. [Agent](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/agent) component now returns a `last_message` output for quick access to the final message, and can use a `streaming_callback` to emit tool results in real time. You can use the updated `print_streaming_chunk` or write your own callback function to enable ToolCall details during streaming.

```python
from haystack.components.websearch import SerperDevWebSearch
from haystack.components.agents import Agent
from haystack.components.generators.utils import print_streaming_chunk
from haystack.tools import tool, ComponentTool
from haystack.components.generators.chat import OpenAIChatGenerator
from haystack.dataclasses import ChatMessage

web_search = ComponentTool(name="web_search", component=SerperDevWebSearch(top_k=5))
wiki_search = ComponentTool(name="wiki_search", component=SerperDevWebSearch(top_k=5, allowed_domains=["https://www.wikipedia.org/"]))

research_agent = Agent(
    chat_generator=OpenAIChatGenerator(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    system_prompt="""
    You are a research agent that can find information on web or specifically on wikipedia. 
    Use wiki_search tool if you need facts and use web_search tool for latest news on topics.
    Use one tool at a time, use the other tool if the retrieved information is not enough.
    Summarize the retrieved information before returning response to the user.
    """,
    tools=[web_search, wiki_search],
    streaming_callback=print_streaming_chunk
)

result = research_agent.run(messages=[ChatMessage.from_user("Can you tell me about Florence Nightingale's life?")])
```
Enabling streaming with `print_streaming_chunk` function looks like this:
```bash 
[TOOL CALL]
Tool: wiki_search 
Arguments: {"query":"Florence Nightingale"}

[TOOL RESULT]
{'documents': [{'title': 'List of schools in Nottinghamshire', 'link': 'https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Nottinghamshire', 'position': 1, 'id': 'a6d0fe00f1e0cd06324f80fb926ba647878fb7bee8182de59a932500aeb54a5b', 'content': 'The Florence Nightingale Academy, Eastwood; The Flying High Academy, Mansfield; Forest Glade Primary School, Sutton-in-Ashfield; Forest Town Primary School ...', 'blob': None, 'score': None, 'embedding': None, 'sparse_embedding': None}], 'links': ['https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Nottinghamshire']}
...

```
Print the `last_message`
```python
print("Final Answer:", result["last_message"].text)
>>> Final Answer: Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) was a pioneering figure in nursing and is often hailed as the founder of modern nursing. She was born...
```
Additionally, [AnswerBuilder](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/answerbuilder) stores all generated messages in `all_messages` meta field of GeneratedAnswer and supports a new `last_message_only` mode for lightweight flows where only the final message needs to be processed.


### Visualizing Pipelines with SuperComponents
We extended `pipeline.draw()` and `pipeline.show()`, which save pipeline diagrams to images files or display them in Jupyter notebooks. You can now pass `super_component_expansion=True` to expand any SuperComponents and draw more detailed visualizations.

Here is an example with a pipeline containing [MultiFileConverter](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/multifileconverter) and [DocumentPreprocssor](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentpreprocessor) SuperComponents. After installing the dependencies that the `MultiFileConverter` needs for all supported file formats via `pip install haystack-ai pypdf markdown-it-py mdit_plain trafilatura python-pptx python-docx jq openpyxl tabulate pandas`, you can run:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from haystack import Pipeline
from haystack.components.converters import MultiFileConverter
from haystack.components.preprocessors import DocumentPreprocessor
from haystack.components.writers import DocumentWriter
from haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore

document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()

pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_component("converter", MultiFileConverter())
pipeline.add_component("preprocessor", DocumentPreprocessor())
pipeline.add_component("writer", DocumentWriter(document_store = document_store))
pipeline.connect("converter", "preprocessor")
pipeline.connect("preprocessor", "writer")

# expanded pipeline that shows all components
path = Path("expanded_pipeline.png")
pipeline.draw(path=path, super_component_expansion=True)

# original pipeline
path = Path("original_pipeline.png")
pipeline.draw(path=path)
```

### SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker with PyTorch, ONNX, and OpenVINO
We added a new [SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencetransformerssimilarityranker) component that uses the Sentence Transformers library to rank documents based on their semantic similarity to the query. This component replaces the legacy `TransformersSimilarityRanker` component, which may be deprecated in a future release, with removal following a deprecation period. The `SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker` also allows choosing different inference backends: PyTorch, ONNX, and OpenVINO. For example, after installing `sentence-transformers>=4.1.0`, you can run:

```python
from haystack.components.rankers import SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker
from haystack.utils.device import ComponentDevice

onnx_ranker = SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker(
    model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    token=None,
    device=ComponentDevice.from_str("cpu"),
    backend="onnx",
)
onnx_ranker.warm_up()
docs = [Document(content="Berlin"), Document(content="Sarajevo")]
output = onnx_ranker.run(query="City in Germany", documents=docs)
ranked_docs = output["documents"]
```

## ⬆️ Upgrade Notes

-   We've added a `py.typed` file to Haystack to enable type information to be used by downstream projects, in line with PEP 561. This means Haystack's type hints will now be visible to type checkers in projects that depend on it. Haystack is primarily type checked using mypy (not pyright) and, despite our efforts, some type information can be incomplete or unreliable. If you use static type checking in your own project, you may notice some changes: previously, Haystack's types were effectively treated as `Any`, but now actual type information will be available and enforced. We'll continue improving typing with the next release.
-   The deprecated `deserialize_tools_inplace` utility function has been removed. Use `deserialize_tools_or_toolset_inplace` instead, importing it as follows: `from haystack.tools import deserialize_tools_or_toolset_inplace`.

## 🚀 New Features

-   Added `run_async` method to `ToolInvoker` class to allow asynchronous tool invocations.

-   Agent can now stream tool result with `run_async` method as well.

-   Introduced `serialize_value` and `deserialize_value` utility methods for consistent value (de)serialization across modules.

-   Moved the `State` class to the `agents.state` module and added serialization and deserialization capabilities.

-   Add support for multiple outputs in ConditionalRouter

-   Implement JSON-safe serialization for OpenAI usage data by converting token counts and details (like CompletionTokensDetails and PromptTokensDetails) into plain dictionaries.

-   Added a new `SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker` component that uses the Sentence Transformers library to rank documents based on their semantic similarity to the query. This component is a replacement for the legacy `TransformersSimilarityRanker` component, which may be deprecated in a future release, with removal following after a deprecation period. The `SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker` also allows choosing different inference backends: PyTorch, ONNX, and OpenVINO. To use the `SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker`, you need to install `sentence-transformers>=4.1.0`.

-   Add a `streaming_callback` parameter to `ToolInvoker` to enable streaming of tool results. Note that tool_result is emitted only after the tool execution completes and is not streamed incrementally.

-   Update `print_streaming_chunk` to print ToolCall information if it is present in the chunk's metadata.

-   Update `Agent` to forward the `streaming_callback` to `ToolInvoker` to emit tool results during tool invocation.

-   Enhance SuperComponent's type compatibility check to return the detected common type between two input types.

## ⚡️ Enhancement Notes

-   When using HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator with streaming, the returned ChatMessage now contains the number of prompt tokens and completion tokens in its meta data. Internally, the HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator requests an additional streaming chunk that contains usage data. It then processes the usage streaming chunk to add usage meta data to the returned ChatMessage.

-   We now have a Protocol for TextEmbedder. The protocol makes it easier to create custom components or SuperComponents that expect any TextEmbedder as init parameter.

-   We added a `Component` signature validation method that details the mismatches between the `run` and `run_async` method signatures. This allows a user to debug custom components easily.

-   Enhanced the AnswerBuilder component with two agent-friendly features:

    1.  All generated messages are now stored in the `meta` field of the GeneratedAnswer objects under an `all_messages` key, improving traceability and debugging capabilities.
    2.  Added a new `last_message_only` parameter that, when set to `True`, processes only the last message in the replies while still preserving the complete conversation history in metadata. This is particularly useful for agent workflows where only the final response needs to be processed.

-   A variety of improvements have been made so an Agent component can be directly used in ComponentTool enabling straightforward building of Multi-Agent systems. These improvements include:

    -   Adding a `last_message` field to the Agent's output which returns the last generated ChatMessage.
    -   Improving the `_default_output_handler` in the `ToolInvoker` to try and first serialize the outputs in the tool result before converting it into a string. This is especially relevant for getting a better representation when stringifying dataclasses like ChatMessage.

-   Added type hints to the `component` decorator. This improves support for Pyright/Pylance, enabling IDEs like VSCode to show docstrings for components.

-   Updated pipeline execution logic to use a new utility method `_deepcopy_with_exceptions`, which attempts to deep copy an object and safely falls back to the original object if copying fails. Additionally `_deepcopy_with_exceptions` skips deep-copying of `Component`, `Tool`, and `Toolset` instances when used as runtime parameters. This prevents errors and unintended behavior caused by trying to deepcopy objects that contain non-copyable attributes (e.g. Jinja2 templates, clients). Previously, standard `deepcopy` was used on inputs and outputs which occasionally lead to errors since certain Python objects cannot be deepcopied.

-   Refactored JSON Schema generation for ComponentTool parameters using Pydantic’s model_json_schema, enabling expanded type support (e.g. Union, Enum, Dict, etc.). We also convert dataclasses to Pydantic models before calling model_json_schema to preserve docstring descriptions of the parameters in the schema. This means dataclasses like ChatMessage, Document, etc. now have correctly defined JSON schemas.

-   The `draw()` and `show()` methods from `Pipeline` now have an extra boolean parameter, `super_component_expansion`, which, when set to `True` and if the pipeline contains SuperComponents, the visualisation diagram will show the internal structure of super-components as if they were components part of the pipeline instead of a "black-box" with the name of the SuperComponent.

-   Improve the type annotations for `@component` and the `Component` protocol. The type checker can now ensure that a `@component` class provides a compatible `run()` method, whose required return type has been changed from `Dict[str, Any]` (invariant) to the `Mapping[str, Any]` to allow `TypedDict` to be used for output types.

-   -   Updates StreamingChunk construction in ToolInvoker to also stream a chunk with a finish reason. This is useful when using the print_streaming_chunk utility method
    -   Update the print_streaming_chunk to have better formatting of messages especially when using it with Agent.
    -   Also updated to work with the current version of the AWS Bedrock integration by working with the dict representation of ChoiceDeltaToolCall

-   ComponentTool now preserves and combines docstrings from underlying pipeline components when wrapping a SuperComponent. When a SuperComponent is used with ComponentTool, two key improvements are made:

    1.  Parameter descriptions are now extracted from the original components in the wrapped pipeline. When a single input is mapped to multiple components, the parameter descriptions are combined from all mapped components, providing comprehensive information about how the parameter is used throughout the pipeline.
    2.  The overall component description is now generated from the descriptions of all underlying components instead of using the generic SuperComponent description. This helps LLMs understand what the component actually does rather than just seeing "Runs the wrapped pipeline with the provided inputs."

    These changes make SuperComponents much more useful with LLM function calling as the LLM will get detailed information about both the component's purpose and its parameters.

-   Adds `local_files_only` parameter to `SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder` and `SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder` to allow loading models in offline mode.

-   The `DocumentRecallEvaluator` was updated. Now, when in `MULTI_HIT` mode, the division is over the unique ground truth documents instead of the total number of ground truth documents. We also added checks for emptiness. If there are no retrieved documents or all of them have an empty string as content, we return 0.0 and log a warning. Likewise, if there are no ground truth documents or all of them have an empty string as content, we return 0.0 and log a warning.

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notes

-   Deprecated the `State` class in the `dataclasses` module. Users are encouraged to transition to the new version of `State` now located in the `agents.state` module. A deprecation warning has been added to guide this migration.

## 🔒 Security Notes

-   Made QUOTE_SPANS_RE regex in SentenceSplitter ReDoS-safe. This prevents potential backtracking on malicious inputs.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

-   Fixed a potential ReDoS issue in QUOTE_SPANS_RE regex used inside the SentenceSplitter component.
-   Add the init parameters timeout and max_retries to the to_dict methods of OpenAITextEmbedder and OpenAIDocumentEmbedder. This ensures that these values are properly serialized when using the to_dict method of these components.
-   use coerce_tag_value in LoggingTracer to serialize tag values
-   Update the `__deepcopy__` of ComponentTool to gracefully handle NotImplementedError when trying to deepcopy attributes.
-   Fix an issue where OpenAIChatGenerator and OpenAIGenerator were not properly handling wrapped streaming responses from tools like Weave.
-   A bug in the `RecursiveDocumentSplitter` was fixed for the case where a `split_text` is longer than the `split_length` and recursive chunking is triggered.
-   Make internal tool conversion in the HuggingFaceAPICompatibleChatGenerator compatible with `huggingface_hub>=0.31.0`. In the huggingface_hub library, `arguments` attribute of `ChatCompletionInputFunctionDefinition` has been renamed to `parameters`. Our implementation is compatible with both the legacy version and the new one.
-   The `HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator` now checks the type of the `arguments` variable in the tool calls returned by the Hugging Face API. If `arguments` is a JSON string, it is parsed into a dictionary. Previously, the `arguments` type was not checked, which sometimes led to failures later in the tool workflow.
-   Move deserialize_tools_inplace back to original import path of from haystack.tools.tool import deserialize_tools_inplace.
-   To properly preserve the context when AsyncPipeline with components that only have sync run methods we copy the context using contextvars.copy_context() and run the component using `ctx.run(...)` so we can preserve context like the active tracing span. This now means if your component 1) only has a sync run method and 2) it logs something to the tracer then this trace will be properly nested within the parent context.
- Fixed a bug in the `LLMMetadataExtractor` that occurred when processing `Document` objects with `None` or empty string content. The component now gracefully handles these cases by marking such documents as failed and providing an appropriate error message in their metadata, without attempting an LLM call.
- Fix component_invoker used by ComponentTool to work when a dataclass like ChatMessage is directly passed to `component_tool.invoke(...)`. Previously this would either cause an error or silently skip your input.
